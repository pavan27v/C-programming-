Ethernet 
Ethernet over fiber optics → long-distance communication (kilometers to tens of kilometers)
Ethernet over copper (Cat5/Cat6) → short-distance communication (up to ~100 meters)
Why fiber works for long distance
Light signals travel farther without losing strength
Immune to electromagnetic interference (important in aircraft & telecom)

Higher bandwidth possible
Why copper is short range
Electrical signals get weaker over distance
High interference sensitivity
Heat & resistance cause noise

What is a MAC Header?

The MAC Header is the first part of an Ethernet frame.
It contains information needed by network hardware (Network Interface Cards and Switches) to correctly deliver the frame to the destination machine on a LAN.
